NewSmearedFaults
was created after the author realized
that the hotwire classification was causing abnormal 
bias because the activation of hotwire was set 
to 2 -10 times the max of the entire dataset

The fix, in Fault.java, was 
else if (this.subFaultName.equals(FaultNames.HOTWIRE)) {
				smearValue = ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextInt(200, 400);
				}
200-400 represents 2-4 times, i.e. 				
lowValue = ((double) smearValue) / 100.0 - 0.05;
highValue = ((double) smearValue) / 100.0; 	
This number is applied to the median value of the neighbors of the fault, 			
just like all other faults.

This gives a better visual representation of the faults and there is no washing
or bias cause by the hotwire 
Run the main in
package faults;
FaultFactory.java
